<h2>OPEN THE FUTURE</h2>

<br>

     <p>During 10 years, I worked in the import-export sector, sending indutrial tools and vehicles around the world. During this period, managing payments, customs, etc. I always worked close to all different IT projects and migrations. At the beginning more like a key user but at the end, more like a Data Base Administrator. Since I was very young, I always had an IT mindset and that's why I decided to reorient my carreer in functions more close to my real aspirations. So today, I manage both logistic skills and Web Developer skills. And I will be very glad to help you to create the future of your company !!!
